# Questions for Analysis

1. out of all each tray listed, how many items have been reported missing? per week?
(i.e. I want to be able to say, there were 6 items missing this week, 6 items missing the next week, etc.)

2. How many of those missing instruments were the same ones missing the next week? (for a given tray)
(i.e. surrogate measure to answer the question of how long were items missing for? how long did it take to replace?)

3. What is the percentage of missing instruments for a given tray? for all tray types? Week to week analysis

4. What is the most common missing instrument across all trays? (provide list with frequency ideally from week to week)

5. How many instruments in total are missing in a given week?

### SPECIAL
There is a cost analysis that would be awesome to preform as well. We should talk about it later, but let's focus on answering these questions first.

### Formatting

Ideally I would like to be able to see something that answers these questions above. Idk something like this below? Maybe? Frankly, you know better how to display data best so I give you freedom to figure out the easiest method to answer these questions best.

Week 1:
X = trays;     % missing instruments this week       % missing instruments missing this week                  list of missing 
                                                                                 that were missing from last week
x1 =                         8%                                                   95%                                                                      list
x2
x3
